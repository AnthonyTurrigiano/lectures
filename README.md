- Audience: [Master 2](https://www.univ-lehavre.fr/fiches-oiseau/SMMA.pdf) (Course IDOD) from the University of Le Havre.



## Syllabus

This lecture reviews the main technologies and standards used for Web development.

Standards at play are essentially the new HTML5 and CSS3 family of standards as well as new versions of JavaScript (EcmaSript 6).

Technology still relies on the HTTP protocol (althaugh HTTP2 is on its way) for the transport of information. Javascript has become a central language where complete data models rely on it rather than being used for occasional animations on the page.
